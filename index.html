							<h3>30 Pieces of Silver</h3>
							<p class="single">As everyone and their mom knows, there were 12 disciples. Over the last few days, as part of my reflection on the Passion, I've been thinking about 2 of them in particular.</p>

							<h3>Free Will and Time</h3>
							<p class="single">I've been trying to cohesively meld my theological and philisophical together - if I'm a consistent and logical person, this should not be difficult. We'll see how it goes. This is part one.</p>

							<h3>Plato</h3>
							<p class="single">	I've started reading some Plato recently, after an acquaintance introduced me to	this set of tetralogies put together by Bernard Suzanne. He's organized these tetralogies in a way that is supposed to build on itself and go through Plato's dialogues the way he imagines that Plato would have wanted. It's kind of like how they say that there's a certain order you should watch all the Star Wars movies, which isn't the normal order. This is a similar thing, but with Plato instead of space operas. Anyways, Suzanne structures Plato's dialogues into 7 sets of 4 dialogues with a repeating theme that builds up.</p>

							<h3>Crowning of Thorns</h3>
							<p class="single">Throughout Lent, I’ve been praying the rosary much more frequently. As a result of this more frequent prayer, I’ve lessened my focus on the sets of mysteries, and started to look at the mysteries for themselves. For example, instead of praying all five Sorrowful Mysteries in a rigid set, sometimes I'll pray the Crowning With Thorns five times in a row. Breaking this mold has helped me to look at each mystery from a perspective I hadn’t considered before. That being said, here are my thoughts on the Crowning with Thorns.</p>

							<h3>What are you worth?</h3>
							<p class="single">When someone asks you who you are, the answer could be anything. A career - engineer, scientist, artist, writer, NEET, etc. Or some defining features - my laziness, my anger issues, my addictions. Or maybe it's something else entirely - my hairdo, or my signature water bottle, or the weird way I walk.</p>
