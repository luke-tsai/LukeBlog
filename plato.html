			<div id="main"><h2>Plato</h2>	I've started reading some Plato recently, after an acquaintance introduced me to	<a href="https://www.dialogues-de-platon.org/tetralog.htm" target="_blank">this set of tetralogies put together by Bernard Suzanne.</a> He's organized these tetralogies in a way that is supposed to build on itself and go through Plato's dialogues the way he imagines that Plato would have wanted. It's kind of like how they say that there's a certain order you should watch all the Star Wars movies, which isn't the normal order. This is a similar thing, but with Plato instead of space operas. Anyways, Suzanne structures Plato's dialogues into 7 sets of 4 dialogues with a repeating theme that builds up.</p><p class="bottom">Ever since I've started the process of reading the dialogues, I've been thinking that Plato's works are a fantastic introduction to starting to think deeply. I think most people would benefit from reading him. It's a shame, I think, that such a staple of classical education was never required at any point growing up. I'm a big fan of the structure he uses - just a conversation between a few characters. Often times, I think philosophy tends to be a set of complex arguments that are very easy to lose track of. The dialogues do a great job of getting people to ask questions they've never asked before.</p><p class="bottom">However, despite being well-suited for beginners and easily accessible for anyone to read, I still think it might be too inaccessible. They are often too verbose, an unavoidable effect of translating conversations that are thousands of years old. Perhaps there's a need for a "translation" of Plato that uses simple language and throws out all the complex parts. I know, I know - Plato fans would be incensed at the suggestion, but I think there's some good in it. I think getting more people to question the world and think deeply can only be a good thing.</p><a href='index.html'>< Return to Blog</a>			</div>
